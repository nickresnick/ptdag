# Description
ptdag is an application for generating [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) visualizations of [PivotalTracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) projects and epics.

At [custora](https://custora.com/), we use Pivotal to scope, plan, and manage engineering projects across our software development and data science teams. One thing that always frustrated me about Pivotal is that it's really hard to grasp certain aspects of a project from the UI: How big is the scope? Where are the bottlenecks? Are there any unhashed dependencies? Can we parallelize tasks?

I built ptdag to help answer these questions. Each node in the graph represents a pivotal story, and each edge that points from node A to node B signifies that node B depends on the completion of node A. The app includes features for scaling the size of the node based on the amount of points on the story, as well as color encoding based on story type and status.

ptdag runs on the robust [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) infrastructure through the [ruby-graphviz](https://github.com/glejeune/Ruby-Graphviz) gem. I recommend looking through the `examples` directory of that gem for some cool implementations of graph visualizations.

# Generating a Graph
Generating a graph is easy. All you need is...
1. Your Pivotal API token. You can find this by clicking on Profile under your username in the top right corner of the Pivotal home screen after signing in.
2. The project id. You can find this most easily by clicking into the project of interest and selecting the seven digit number in the URL.
3. (Optional) If you want to generate a DAG for an epic instead of an entire project, you must supply the epic name _exactly_ as it appears in the Pivotal UI.
4. A file path and file format for your sweeeeeet new graph

Place these values under the PivotalSettings and OutputSettings headers in config.yml, like so:
```
PivotalSettings:
  APIKey: f00bar
  ProjectID: 0000000
  EpicName: My Epic

OutputSettings:
  FileFormat: pdf
  FilePath: generated_dags/my_dag.pdf
```

config.yml is your home for all graph settings. It includes GraphAttributes, NodeAttributes, and EdgeAttributes, all of which are passed through to GraphViz. As of writing, only a small subset of GraphViz's configs are supported.

To run the script after config.yml has been updated, simply run
```
ruby run.rb
```
in the ptdag directory. This will create a file according to the file format and
file path you entered in config.yml.

# Example
Here's an example of a graph I generated from a real project I was working on at custora (the graph name, story titles, and story ids have been replaces/randomized):
